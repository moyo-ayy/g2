        HAPPY BIRTHDAY GIRLFRIEND!!! My stinky fart ball butt farty butt. I hope
        you’re having an amazing day! I’m sorry I can’t be there. AGHHH!!! (I’m
        tweaking). I’m so happy today is your day and everyone around you gets
        to celebrate the beam of sunshine that you are!!{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for being you Georgia. Thank you for letting me into your
        life. Thank you for being more than what I could ever ask for in a
        girlfriend. Thank you for showing me that I still have love to give.  Even when I’m not the perfect boyfriend you’re so patient
        and sweet and caring and thoughtful. I’m grateful to have a girlfriend
        that celebrates me at my highs and supports me at my lows. I’m lucky to
        have someone who I can talk to about all my stresses and worries. Even
        when I feel so lost, you share your light with me. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I cherish the moments we share. From making french toast sticks on a
        rainy Saturday morning to getting yummy chick-fil-a breakfast. I love waking up with you asleep by my side. I love running through the rain into the car with you.
        Everything with you just feels so much more special (I legit can’t
        process eating vodka pasta without girlfriend). You mean so much to me
        and I cant wait for us to grow more together. I get so excited thinking
        about all the moments we’re gonna share in the future (MANIFESTING THAT
        ERIC WANG HOUSE AND LIFESTYLE).
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope you acquire all that your heart desires and find success in the
        things that you love. <i>I love you from the bottom of my heart and can’t
        wait to see you soon.</i>
      </p>
